          <h2>Inspiration</h2>
          <p>Meet my baby, <strong>Luna</strong>, who inspired the creation of Dog Days Events. She showed me how much dogs thrive when they have a safe place to socialize, exercise, and be loved. This community space is dedicated to giving all dogs—big or small, shy or bold—the opportunity to live happier, healthier lives alongside their humans.</p>
